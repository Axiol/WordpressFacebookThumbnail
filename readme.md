# [Custom Facebook and Google+ Thumbnail]()

Sometimes, you want Facebook or Google+ (or any sharing website) to use a specific thumbnail. Sometimes, you even want to use a thumbnail which is not in your article (when it's a video by example). This plug-in make these websites use the thumbnail from your Wordpress article.

If you define a thumbnail for your article, it will use it. If not, it will act the normal way.

[Also avalable as a plug-in here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-facebook-and-google-thumbnail/)

* Copy the code in your `funtions.php`
